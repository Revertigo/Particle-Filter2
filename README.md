# Overview
This project is an implementation of paritcle filter algorithm as part of Navigation Algorithms course.
This time, the algorithm uses a real data in order to track and locate the moving target. The data split into four categories:  
- Map data i.e. the (X,Y) location of the landmarks  
- Control data i.e. velocity and yaw rate (rotation rate, angular velocity) of the moving target (Robot)  
- Ground Truth i.e. the actual location of the moving target  
- Observations from landmarks
